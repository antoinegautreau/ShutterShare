# ShutterShare
Overview Of Use & Purpose
ShutterShare is a mobile app built in Android Studio using Kotlin. The purpose is to be able to take a photo during an event and share it with people where you can only view it once the event is over.
The use of it is that you can add/create events(via event code) and then you can contribute to that event with your photos. 

## Getting Started

### Installing
* Before running the app make sure that the app is connected to Firebase. Once you have opened the ShutterShare project in Android Studio, click on the 'Tools' menu in the top bar and then click on 'Firebase'.
* In the new window that pops up, click on the drop-down menu for 'Authentication' and click on the link that says 'Authenticate using a custom authentication system'.
* Now find the 'Realtime Database' drop-down menu and click on the link that says 'Get started with Realtime Database'.
* Lastly, find the 'Cloud Storage for Firebase' drop-down menu and click on the link that says 'Get started with Cloud Storage'.


### Executing the program
* When the app starts you will be presented with a login screen. Make sure to create an account first by clicking on the 'Not Registered Yet? Sign Up!' at the bottom of the page. This will bring you to a account registration page. Make an account and then login using the credentials you just created the account with.
